# Patterns and SOLID

This repo represents some useful examples of what patterns in programming is, and how SOLID works. The whole project 
is more like a note, rather than a bunch of working applications.

## Structure

You will find 2 main folders:

1. Patterns
2. SOLID

In each of them, there are several subdirectories, each of them represents a pattern or a single SOLID principle. 
Inside you will find code examples, that implements corresponding Pattern or Principle. Also, you can find a 
description for each of them, which will explain in details:

- What the heck is going on here?
- Why should I care?
- When should I care?

Overall, these are basic, ground and kinda practical explanations, of what are these things and why should you care.
I found it hard to pinpoint something as well practical, as I did here, on Web. There, explanations are often either 
too complicated or are being shown without explaining actual practical use-cases.

Feel free to do what ever you want with this, hope this helps.
